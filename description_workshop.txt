TerraSouls – The Ultimate Souls-Like Experience in Terraria

Immerse yourself in a dark and challenging Terraria, inspired by the Dark Souls series.
With TerraSouls, every fight is more strategic, every death more meaningful, and every victory much more satisfying.

What You'll Find
- Player Progression System: Level up and strengthen your character with Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Faith.
- Weapon Scaling: Your stats define the true power of your weapons.
- Bloodstains: When you die, you leave a trail that preserves your souls and humanity. Will you be able to recover them?
- Deeper Elemental Combat:
- NPCs and bosses now have unique resistances and weaknesses to fire, ice, poison, and lightning.
- Some bosses reduce elemental damage even further—be prepared to think strategically!
- New items and legendary rings with unique effects to enhance your playstyle.
- Special drops: from rare rings on zombies to powerful souls upon defeating bosses.
- New atmosphere: Redesigned start and death screens with a somber and immersive feel.

What's to come:
- This is just the beginning. Coming soon:
